# Style Challenge

Given an HTML file `index.html` with article content in it, make it look beautiful.

Rules:

- Do not change the markup (HTML)
- Only modify the `main.scss` file.
- Work independently for 20 minutes
- Push your work to your forked repo
- Wait for instructions

## Install

1. __Fork the repository__

2.  Clone the repo to your local machine
  
3.  Install dependencies

  ```bash
  // If not already installed
  brew update
  brew install ruby
  sudo gem install sass
  
  npm install
  bower install
  ```

4. Run `grunt serve`
